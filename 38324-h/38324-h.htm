<h3><span>PROVERBIAL PHILOSOPHY.</span></h3>

<p>The following "sententious truths" are extracted from Bishop Jewel's
grand performance, <i>A Defense of the Apologie of the Churche of
Englande</i>, fol. 1571, a work as remarkable for "the pomp and charms" of
its eloquence, as for the profound erudition, and the consummate
ability, with which its "good doctrine" is exhibited and enforced. In
common, however, with the other productions of this illustrious champion
of the Reformation, it has an additional and most attractive feature;
one, indeed, which, less or more, characterises all the literary
achievements of the gigantic geniuses of the Elizabethan period, the
"very dust of whose writings is gold."<a id="gold1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
 The "Defense" abounds with
<i>proverbial folk-lore</i> of the rarest sort; and this is so skilfully and
appositely introduced, that the subject-matter presents itself to the
reader's mind rather as a corollary, naturally deduced from a
self-evident proposition&mdash;for who would think for a moment of
questioning the truth of what has the semblance of a popular
adage?<a id="adag2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;than
 as a nicely managed argument, which receives no other
help from the latter than that of illustration, employed for the simple
and single purpose, not of strengthening such argument, but of rendering
it comprehensible by the "meanest capacities."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#gold1" class="label">[1]</a>
 Bentley, of Bp. Pearson, in <i>Dissert. on Phalaris.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#adag2" class="label">[2]</a>
 I have somewhere met with an amusing instance of this. It
seems that Dean Swift, with a party of friends, were invited to view the
garden of a gentleman, the walls of which were laden with peaches of a
most tempting ripeness, but which they were strictly forbidden to touch.
This injunction was followed, until Swift ('twas like him) at length put
forth his hand and plucked, at the same time observing, with all
becoming gravity, "As my deeply venerated grandmother used to say,</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p class="i5">  'Never fail to pluck a peach,</p>
   <p class="i5">  Whene'er you find one in your reach.'"</p>
</div>

<p class="footnote">'Twas enough. The authority of the adage was sufficient to overrule
every other obligation; and the rest of the company, much to the disgust
of the master of the garden, immediately proceeded, with infinite gusto,
to follow the Dean's example, not for a moment doubting the propriety of
the act. "The court awards it, and the law doth give it."</p>

<p>With this little bit of criticism, let me take the liberty of
recommending to such of your readers, and I trust they are many, who
seek for knowledge and wisdom in the richly-stored tomes, especially of
the divines, whose appearance imparted a further glory to the days of
our "good queen Bess," to note down the "wise saws and modern instances"
which lie scattered along their glowing periods, like "dew-drops on the
flow'ry lawn," for the purpose of transferring them to your very
appropriate pages.<a id="very82"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>The remark of our old lexicographer, Florio<a id="lexi3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,
 that "daily both new
words are invented, and books still found that make a new supply of
old," may, in its latter part, very fitly be applied to our proverbial
philosophy; for, great as is the light which has already been thrown
upon the subject, it must be admitted that a more <i>systematic</i>
examination than they have yet received, of the works of the Elizabethan
writers, would elucidate it to an extent that can scarcely be
appreciated.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#lexi3" class="label">[3]</a>
 <i>Worlde of Wordes</i>, Ital. and Eng. Pr. 1598.</p>

<p>With these observations I offer you my little string of pearls, under
the hope that row after row may be added to it.</p>

<ul class="blockquot">
<li>   "1. A contentious man wil never lacke wordes.</li>

<li>   2. A Judge must walke with feete of lead.</li>

<li>   3. An ignorante Judge was never indifferente.</li>

<li>   4. A simple eie is soone beguiled.</li>

<li>   5. By a smal draughte of sea-water, though maiste judge the verdure of the whole.</li>

<li>   6. Error can not be defended, but by error.</li>

<li>   7. Evils must be cured by theire contraries.</li>

<li>   8. He is very doumbe, and can speak but little, that cannot speake ill.</li>

<li>   9. He that cannot judge Golde by sounde, or in sight, yet may trie it by the poise.</li>

<li>   10. Il wil is ever plentiful of il woordes.</li>

<li>   11. In the fairest rose thou maiste soonest finde a canker.</li>

<li>   12. It is a desperate cause, that with woordes and eloquence maie not be smoothed.</li>

<li>   13. It is very course woulle that will take no colour.</li>

<li>   14. Let Reason leade thee; let Authoritie move thee; let Truthe enforce thee.</li>

<li>   15. Of an Impossibilitie yee maie conclude what yee liste.</li>

<li>   16. Oftentimes he is hardiest man to speake, that hathe leaste to saie.</li>

<li>   17. One demanded this question of Zoilus the Railer: Why takest thou sutche pleasure in speaking il? Zoilus made answere, Bicause, whereas I woulde doo it, I am not hable.</li>

<li>   18. Rashe judgemente argueth somme folie.</li>

<li>   19. The Heares of a mannes Bearde, or Heade, never ware white al togeather.</li>

<li>   20. The mouthe which speaketh untruth killeth the soule.</li>

<li>   21. The report of an enimie maketh no proufe.</li>

<li>   22. The slowe paced horses kepe backe the chariot.</li>

<li>   23. The Truthe wilbe hable evermore to beare it selfe.</li>

<li>   24. To mainteine a fault knowne, is a double faulte.</li>

<li>   25. To spende woordes without cause, is affliction of the sprite, and losse of time.</li>

<li>   26. Vesselles never geve so great a sounde, as when they be emptie.</li>

<li>   27. Untruthe cannot be shielded, but by untruthe.</li>

<li>   28. Where the woulfe is broken in, it is beste for the poor sheepe to breake out."</li>
</ul>

<p>It is as well to remark that the above aphorisms are contained within
the first 365 pages of the "Defense." Their orthography and punctuation
have been carefully preserved, as they ought always to be in such like
cases. Some of them I have not elsewhere met with, and others present
<i>variæ lectiones</i> of an interesting character. They are all delivered in
a quaint simplicity of style, which admirably illustrates the general
tone of thought and language of the period.</p>

<h3><span>PARAPHRASE ON THE 137TH PSALM BY CHURCHILL.</span></h3>

<p>A paraphrase of the 137th psalm by Charles Churchill may, perhaps, be
deemed not unworthy of a place amongst your Notes. It was originally
sent to Mrs. Baily of Cadbury, who had remonstrated with him on his
devoting his pen exclusively to satire. That lady gave them to my
maternal grandfather. Three lines of the last verse are lost.</p>

 To these beautiful and glowing lines the author has
appended the following:</p>

       <div class="poem">
  <p class="i7"> <ins title="[Greek: Ophthalmous estian.]">"&nbsp;&#8008;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#955;&#956;&#959;&#8058;&#962;

</div>



<p>It seems to me that the noble poet has condescended to avail himself of
a little <i>ruse</i> in referring to this passage of Ovid. It would have been
perhaps more honest to have referred his readers to those magnificent
lines in the opening address to Venus, by Lucretius, "De Rerum Naturâ,"
beginning,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
 <p> "Æneadum genitrix, hominum divômque voluptas,</p>
      <p>Alma Venus!" &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>I subjoin the verses which Lord Byron <i>really</i> had in mind when he wrote
the foregoing stanzas:</p>

 <div class="poem">
    <p> "Nam tu sola potes tranquillâ pace juvare</p>
      <p>Mortaleis: quoniam belli fera m&oelig;nera Mavors</p>
     <p> Armipotens regit, <i>in gremium</i> qui sæpe <i>tuum se</i></p>
      <p>Rejicit, æterno devictus volnere Amoris:</p>
     <p> Atque <i>ita, suspiciens</i> tereti cervice reposta</p>
     <p> <i>Pascit amore avidos, inhians in te, Dea, visus;</i></p>
     <p> Eque tuo pendet resupini spiritus ore.</p>

      <p><i>Circumfusa super</i>, suaveis ex ore loquelas</p>
      <p>Funde, petens placidam Romanis, incluta, pacem."</p>
</div>

<p>Surely if the author of <i>Childe Harold</i> were indebted to <i>any</i> ancient
poet for some ideas embodied in the lines cited, it was to Lucretius and
not to Ovid that he should have owned the obligation.</p>

from the Welsh word <i>porth</i>, a port or harbour. This word is under
certain circumstances written <i>borth</i>, according to the rules of Welsh
grammar. A ship's place in harbour (<i>borth</i>) is her <i>berth</i>. A sailor's

<h2><span class="bla">Queries.</span></h2>


<h3><span>JOHN A KENT AND JOHN A CUMBER.</span></h3>

<p>I am much obliged to you, Mr. Editor, for giving additional circulation
to my inquiry (through the medium of the <i>Athenæum</i> of the 19th ult.)
regarding the two ancient popular wizards, John a Kent and John a
Cumber. I was aware, from a note received some time ago from my friend
the Rev. John Webb of Tretire, that there are various current traditions
in Monmouthshire, and that Coxe's history of that county contains some
information regarding one of these worthies. That fact has since been
repeated to me by a gentleman of Newport, who wrote in consequence of
what appeared in the <i>Athenæum</i>, and whose name I do not know that I am
at liberty to mention. I may, however, take this opportunity of thanking
him, as well as the transmitter of the curious particulars printed in
the <i>Athenæum</i> of Saturday last.</p>

<p>One point I wish to ascertain is, whence John a Kent derived his
appellation? This question has not been at all answered. Has his name
any connexion, and what, with the village of Kentchurch, in
Monmouthshire; and why was the place called Kentchurch? To what saint is
the church dedicated? and has the name of that church anything to do
with the name of the saint? Anthony Munday (or Mundy), in his MS. play
(now in my hands by the favour of the Hon. Mr. Mostyn, and by the kind
interposition of Sir F. Madden), does<a id="Sir84"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[84]</span> not give the slightest
clue to the "birth, parentage, and education" of John a Kent. As to John
a Cumber, all we learn is, that he was a Scottish conjuror, employed by
a nobleman of the same country to counteract the proceedings of John a
Kent, who is represented as in the service of Sir Gosselin Denville, a
person who appears, from what Munday says, to have had power and
influence in South Wales.</p>

<p>Now, the name of Sir Gosselin Denville itself suggests a Query; because
I find in Johnson's <i>Lives of Highwayman, &amp;c.,</i> fol. 1734, p. 15. (I do
not of course refer to it as a book of any authority), that there was a
celebrated collector of tribute from travellers who bore that name and
rank. He, however, came from Yorkshire, and lived (according to the
narrative of Johnson, who had it most likely from Capt. A. Smith, whose
work I have not at hand) as long ago as the reign of Edward II. Let me
ask, therefore, whether there exist any tidings respecting such a person
as a native of Wales, and as the "master" (I use Munday's word) of John
a Kent?</p>

<p>But this is not the principal object of my present communication, which
relates to one of the heroines of Munday's drama&mdash;a daughter of
Llewellin, Prince of North Wales. To her the name of Sidanen is given,
and she is constantly spoken of as "the fair Sidanen," with the
additional information, in one place, that "sonnets" had been written in
her praise. Every person who sends a Query must plead ignorance, and
mine may be great as regards Welsh poetry, when I inquire, who was
Sidanen, and where has she been celebrated? By the second volume of
<i>Extracts from the Registers of the Stationers' Company</i> (printed for
the Shakspeare Society), it is evident that she was well known about the
middle of the reign of Elizabeth, for on p. 94. I read the following
entry:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"xiii Augusti [1580]</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Rich. Jones. Rd. of him for printinge a ballat of brittishe
   Sidanen, applied by a courtier to the praise of the Queen."</p>

<p>British Sidanen probably meant Sidanen of Ancient Britain, or Wales, to
whom some unnamed and adulatory courtier had compared Queen Elizabeth. I
fancied also that I recollected, in Warner's <i>Albion's England</i>, some
allusion to Elizabeth under the name of Sidanen, but I cannot at present
find it.</p>

<p>As I have my pen in hand, may I add another word, quite upon a different
subject: it is upon the <i>nimium</i> (pardon the word) <i>vexata questio</i>
about <i>esile</i>, as it is spelt in the first and second folios of
<i>Hamlet</i>. Have any of your correspondents, from M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> to
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">AMPKIN</span>, with all their learning and ingenuity, been able at all to
settle the point? Surely, then, I cannot be blamed for not taking upon
me dogmatically to decide it eight years ago. I stated the two positions
assumed by adverse commentators, and what more could I do? What more
have your friends done? The principle I went upon was to make my notes
as short as possible; and after pages on pages have been employed in
your miscellany, it seems, in my humble judgment, that the case is not
one jot altered. <i>Esile</i> may still either mean vinegar (eyesel) or the
river Eisell.</p>

<h3><span>SWEARING ON THE HORNS AT HIGHGATE.</span></h3>

<p>Can any of your readers give a satisfactory explanation of what Lord
Byron, in the <span class="smcap lowercase">LXX</span>th stanza of the first canto of <i>Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage</i>, calls the <i>worship of the solemn horn</i>? The whole stanza is
as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">
        <p> "Some o'er thy Thamis row the ribbon'd fair,</p>
        <p>Others along the safer turnpike fly;</p>
        <p> Some Richmond Hill ascend, some send to Ware,</p>
        <p>And many to the steep of Highgate hie.</p>
        <p> Ask ye, B&oelig;otian shades! the reason why? <span class="topnum">(15)</span></p>
        <p> 'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,</p>
        <p>Grasp'd in the holy hand of mystery,</p>
        <p> In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,</p>
        <p>And consecrate the oath with draught and dance till morn!"</p>
</div>

<p>And the note <span class="topnum">(15)</span> merely refers to the poet's writing from Thebes, the
capital of B&oelig;otia.</p>

<p>I have a faint recollection of a circumstance which occurred on a
journey from York to town some forty years ago, and which I almost fancy
may throw some distant light on Lord B.'s horn. Among the inside
passengers by the stage was a middle-aged Yorkshireman, apparently a
small farmer, who kept the rest in a continual titter with his account
of various personal adventures, which he related in a style of quaint
and ludicrous simplicity; and as, in the course of conversation, it
appeared that he had never visited the metropolis before, it was
suggested by a couple of wags, that on the arrival of the coach at
Highgate he should be invited "to make himself free of the Horns."
Accordingly, when in due time the vehicle halted at the above-mentioned
place, and the inside passengers, with the exception of York, had
quitted it, an ostler, having received his cue, appeared at the door
with a pole, to which we attached a pair of gilded ram's horns; and
inquired if the "genelman" from Yorkshire, who was on his first visit to
London, wished to obtain his freedom by swearing on the horns, or would
rather forego the ceremony by a payment of the customary fee. The
Yorkshireman was evidently taken aback by the unexpected question; but,
after a moment's hesitation, intimated that he preferred the horns to
forking out the cash. He was thereupon directed with mock solemnity to
place his right hand upon the horns, and to follow the<a id="horns85"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[85]</span>
ostler in reciting a ridiculous formula; which, if I remember right,
consisted in his vowing, under certain penalties, to prefer wine to
water, roast beef and ale to a dry crust and water gruel, the daughter
to the mother, the sister to the brother, laughing to crying, and songs
and glees to requiems and psalms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Can you then oblige me with any information respecting the worship of
the solemn horn alluded to by Lord Byron; and, secondly, with any
account respecting the solemn farce of swearing in strangers on the
horns when reaching Highgate on their first visit to the metropolis,
which farce I presume has long since been exploded by the introduction
of the railway.</p>

   <p class="right"> K<span class="smcap lowercase">EWENSIS</span>.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">[Moore, in his edition of Byron's <i>Works</i>, has the following note
   on this passage:&mdash;"Lord Byron alludes to a ridiculous custom
   which formerly prevailed at the public-houses in Highgate, of
   administering a burlesque oath to all travellers of the middling
   rank who stopped there. The party was sworn on a pair of horns,
   fastened, 'never to kiss the maid when he could kiss the
   mistress; never to eat brown bread when he could get white; never
   to drink small beer when he could get strong;' with many other
   injunctions of the like kind, to all which was added the saving
   clause, 'unless you like it best.'" Our correspondent,
   W. S. G<span class="smcap lowercase">IBSON</span>, Esq., in his <i>Prize Essay on the History and Antiquities
   of Highgate</i>, has preserved some curious notices of this
   burlesque oath. He says, "All attempts to trace the once
   prevalent, but now obsolete, custom of 'swearing at Highgate' to
   any really probable source have proved unavailing, and the custom
   has fallen into disuse. The early identity of the site of the
   present hamlet with the ancient forest, and the vicinity of
   Highgate to a park or chase, naturally suggests the possible
   connexion of these trophies with huntsmen and their horns; and it
   is not difficult to perceive that the spoils and emblems of the
   chase, and the hunter's joyous horn, may in time have acquired
   the character of household gods, and at length, become like the
   sword of the warrior, a sacred emblem upon which vows were taken,
   and the most binding engagements made. It is, however, less
   difficult to imagine the reality of such an origin, than to
   account for the strange degeneracy exhibited in the modern aspect
   of the custom. 'Swearing on the horns' was an observance at all
   events more than a century old; for a song which embodied a close
   paraphrase of the oath, according to the best authorised version
   yet extant, was introduced in a London pantomime at the Haymarket
   Theatre in the year 1742."]</p>

<h4><span>49. <i>Queen Brunéhaut.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I read in a French book of travels that the
abbey of Saint Martin's, at Autun, contained the tomb of Queen
Brunéhaut, upon which was engraved the following inscription:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Ci-gît la Reine Brunéhaut,</p>
      <p>A qui le Saint Pape Gregoire</p>
     <p> Donna des éloges de gloire,</p>
    <p>  Qui mettent sa vertu bien haut.</p>
     <p> Sa piété pour les saints mystères</p>
      <p>Lui fit fonder trois monastères,</p>
     <p> Sous la règle de Saint Benoît:</p>
      <p>Saint Martin, Saint Jean, Saint Andoche,</p>
    <p>  Sont trois saints lieux où l'on connoît</p>
      <p>Qu'elle est exempte de reproche."</p>
</div>

<p>1. Who was the Saint Gregory mentioned in this inscription? I believe
there can be little doubt that it was Pope Gregory I., commonly known as
Gregory the Great, and the cotemporary of Queen Brunéhaut. The only
other Pope of that name, that has been canonized, is Gregory VII., the
famous Hildebrand; but as his canonization did not take place till the
close of the last century (700 years after his death), an inscription,
which, from its obsolete rhymes of "Benoît" and "connoît," bears
internal evidence of having been made in the sixteenth or seventeenth
century, could not have applied to him the epithet <i>Saint</i>.</p>

<p>2. Brunéhaut having been one of the most profligate queens that ever sat
upon a throne, and Gregory the Great one of the most virtuous Popes that
have shed lustre on the tiara, a second Query presents itself:&mdash;Is it
possible that such a Pope could have degraded himself and his office by
eulogising such a queen? The bare idea is at variance with the known
character of that Pope; and the imputation, if substantiated, would
materially detract from his established reputation for piety and wisdom.</p>

<p>3. Is there any passage in the writings of Gregory the Great that can be
cited in support of the allegations of this inscription?</p>

<h4><span>50. <i>Sculptured Stones in the North of Scotland.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Some time ago Patrick
Chalmers, Esq., of Auldbar, in the county of Forfar, obtained drawings
of all the sculptured stone obelisks in Angus, and got them lithographed
for the members of the Bannatyne Club. The work has excited considerable
attention among historical students in this country as well as abroad,
and certainly has laid a foundation for correct comparison of these with
other similar remains of a symbolical nature in other parts of the
country. In Aberdeenshire there is a considerable number of these
obelisks, which, either from the more primitive state of the people, or
the hardness of the granite, are much less elaborate than those in
Angus. None, however, can exceed the obelisks in Easter Ross for beauty
of execution. It is singular that no monument of this class has been
found south of the Forth. The Spalding Club (Aberdeen) proposes to
obtain drawings of all the stones of this description in the North of
Scotland; and the artist who depicted the Angus stones so accurately and
well for Mr. Chalmers has commenced his labours. Circulars have been
sent to the clergy of about 240 parishes in the North, asking for
information as to the locality of any sculptured stones in their
districts, but as yet answers have been obtained from only about 150. It
is probable that where no return has been made, there is no stone of the
description alluded to; but it would be desirable to know that the
Spalding Club had exhausted the matter.</p>

<h4><span>51. <i>Prophecies of Nostradamus.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In a little work I am meditating on
the subject of English Popular Prophecies, I shall have occasion to
introduce a notice of this celebrated astrologer, whose successful
prediction of the Great Rebellion, and consequent English popularity,
almost entitle him to a place among our native vaticinating worthies.</p>

<p>The curious prefiguration of the fate of Charles I. stands thus in the
original edition of the <i>Prophesies</i>: Lyons, 1572, under the head, "A
mes Imprimeurs de Hongrie:"</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>   "Senat de Londres mettront à mal leur Roy."</p>
</div>

<p>In the only other edition to which I have the opportunity of referring,
London, 1672, "Translated and commented upon by Theophilus de
Garencieres," it is much amplified:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
    <p>"<span class="smcap lowercase">XLIX</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza"> <p> "Gand et Bruxelles marcheront contra Anvers.</p>
    <p>Senat de Londres mettront <i>à mort</i> leur Roy.</p>
    <p> Le sel et vin luy seront à l'envers</p>
    <p> Pour eux avoir le Regne or desseroy."</p></div>
</div>

<p>The more literal accuracy of this version, and the number of the
quatrain (interpreted by the commentator to refer to the year of
Charles's death), induce doubts as to its authenticity. Collections of

<h4><span>52. <i>Quaker Expurgated Bible.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In an extremely curious and interesting
volume entitled <i>Quakerism, or the Story of my Life</i>, I meet with the
following passage, p.&nbsp;386.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "About four years ago, an English Friend waited on me, to request
   me to enter my name as a subscriber to an edition of the Bible,
   which a Committee of Friends were intending to publish. The
   printed prospectus stated that the work was designed to be one
   suited for daily perusal in Friends' families; that from it would
   be carefully excluded every passage that was indelicate, and
   unfit for reading aloud; and also those portions which might be
   called dangerous, which it was possible the unlearned and
   unstable might wrest to their own destruction."</p>

<p>Can any of your readers tell whether this expurgated Bible was ever
published, and where it is to be procured?</p>

<p>A copy of the prospectus alluded to would also be very acceptable.</p>

<h4><span>53. <i>Salmon Fishery in the Thames.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;This was once of great importance
to the inhabitants of the villages upon the banks of the Thames, who
appear to have had each their assigned bounds for their fishery. In the
Churchwardens' Book of Wandsworth, under date 1580, is the following
entry:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "M.D. that this yere in som&#772;er the fishinge Rome of
   Wandesworthe was by certen of Putney denyed, and long sute before
   my L. Mayor of London continued, and at the last, accordinge to
   Right, restored by the Lord Mayor and the Councell of London. And
   in this som&#772;er the fysshers of Wandesworthe tooke betweene
   Monday and Saturday seven score salmons in the same fishinge, to
   the gret honor of God."</p>

<p>I have heard my mother say, that Thames salmon was plentiful when she
was a younger woman, and that it was the most esteemed of any. She died
recently, aged eighty-nine.</p>

<p>Shall we ever have Thames salmon again?</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Queries Answered.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>The Twentieth of the Thirty-nine Articles.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In a note to a work
entitled <i>Sketches of the History of Man</i>, Dublin, 1779, at vol.&nbsp;i. p.&nbsp;104. I observe the following statement:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "In the Act 13th of Elizabeth, anno 1571, confirming the
   Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, these Articles are
   not engrossed, but referred to as comprised in a printed book,
   intitled 'Articles agreed to by the whole Clergy in Convocation
   holden at London, 1562.' The forged clause is, 'The Church has
   power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and authority in
   Controversies of Faith.' That clause is not in the Articles
   referred to; nor the slightest hint of any authority with respect
   to matters of faith. In the same year, 1571, the Articles were
   printed both in Latin and English, precisely as in the year 1562.
   But soon after came out spurious editions, in which the said
   clause was foisted into the Twentieth Article, and continues so
   to this day," &amp;c.</p>

<p>This is a grave charge. Is it a true one? I have not at hand the
authorities by which to examine it, and therefore seek an answer from
some of your readers who may be able to give it. My question refers to
the imputation of a clause having been foisted into our Articles of
Faith by a forgery, and still continuing in them; not to the truth of
any part of our Articles as they now stand. To this there is sufficient
testimony.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> [The following note from p.&nbsp;131. of Mr. Hardwick's recently
   published <i>History of the Articles</i> will furnish a reply to this
   Query:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"He (Laud) was accused of forging the contested clause
   in Art.&nbsp;XX. And after appealing to four printed copies of the Articles,
   one of them as early as 1563, and all containing the passage
   which the Puritans disliked, he added, 'I shall make it yet
   plainer: for it is not fit concerning an Article of Religion, and
   an Article of such consequence for the order, truth, and peace of
   the Church, you should rely upon my copies, be they never so many
   or never so ancient. Therefore I sent <i>to the public records in
   my office, and here under my officer's hand, who is public
   notary, is returned to me the Twentieth Article with this
   affirmative clause in it, and there is also the whole body of the
   Articles to be seen.'</i>&mdash;<i>Remains</i>, ii.&nbsp;83. (quoted by Bennet,&nbsp;166.)

   is said to be still extant; Bennet made use of it, and has
   printed it in his <i>Essay</i>, 167-169."]</p>




<h4><span><i>Exons of the Guard.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your readers inform me what are the
duties of these officers, and the derivation of their title? I find, in
the papers describing her Majesty's state ball, the following: "the
exons or capitaines exempts <i>de la garde du corps;</i>" but that does not
throw much light upon the subject.</p>

<p class="right">  E. N. W.</p>
  <p class="left"> Southwark.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[The name of <i>Exempts</i> or <i>Exons</i> is manifestly borrowed from
   that of the officers in the old French <i>Garde du Corps</i>, who were
   styled in their commissions <i>Capitaines Exempts des Gardes du
   Corps</i>. Richelet describes the <i>Exempt</i> as the officer who
   commanded in the absence of the Lieutenant or Ensign, and who had
   charge of the night watch. In both cases, the duties of the
   English and French officers are completely parallel.]<a id="para88"></a>

<h4><span><i>Meaning of "Deal."</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I shall feel greatly obliged to any of the readers
of your entertaining and instructive miscellany, if they can explain the
meaning of the word <i>deal</i>, as used in Exod.&nbsp;xxix.&nbsp;40. A tenth of flour
is the verbal rendering of the Hebrew, the Septuagint, and the Vulgate.
It was introduced by Coverdale and Tyndale, and is, I believe, in all
our English translations except the Puritan or Genevan, which has "a
tenth part;" and Mr John Ray of Glasgow, in his revised translation, who
renders the word "the tenth of an ephah." Is this use of the word <i>deal</i>
noticed in any dictionary?</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> [The word "<i>deal</i>" in the passage referred to by our
   correspondent clearly signifies "<i>part</i>," and corresponds with
   the German "<i>theil</i>." It is from the A-S.; and Chaucer uses the
   phrases "never a <i>del</i>" and "every <i>del</i>," for "never a bit" and
   "every bit." In the <i>Vision of Piers Ploughman</i> we have a nearly
   parallel phrase to that used in our Bibles:</p>

beautiful, the capital letters very fine. It is stated in the preface to
be a translation from the Latin of <i>Rudimentum Noviciorum</i>, with the
addition of the French Chronicles, and made at the instance of André de
la Haye, Seigneur de Chaumot, Paymaster of Sens. It is printed at Paris
in the month of July, 1448, by Pierre le Rouge. In how many volumes is
the work comprised? Is it very scarce?</p>

<h3><span>PASSAGE IN VIRGIL.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 24.)</span></h3>

<p>Your correspondent E<span class="smcap lowercase">RYX</span> inquires, in your paper of July 12, whether
Servius's interpretation of</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Viridesque secant placido æquore silvas."</p>
   <p class="author"> Virg. <i>Æn.</i> viii.&nbsp;96.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">be correct. I beg to reply that it is not. The interpretations of
Servius are almost invariably incorrect; Servius was a very illiterate,
ignorant, and narrow-minded man, and totally unable to understand the
author whom he attempted to illustrate. His comments on Virgil resemble
those which we might expect a hedge schoolmaster in Yorkshire now to
make upon Milton. These comments, which are only valuable on account of
the mythological traditions which are preserved in them, have been very
injurious to the right understanding of Virgil.</p>

<p>The meaning of the passage in question is, that the Æneadæ row up the
river among the green woods, or (literally) "secant silvas," <i>travel the
woods</i>, "placido æquore," <i>on the calm surface of the water</i>, <i>i. e.</i> by
rowing up the placid stream of the river. This, and not that assigned by
Servius following Terentienus, is the true meaning. 1st. Because
<i>secare</i> with the objective case means constantly in Virgil to <i>travel
along</i>. Compare "viam secat ad naves," <i>Æn.</i> vi.&nbsp;902.; "secuit sub
nubibus arcum," v.&nbsp;658., &amp;c. 2ndly. Because the Tiber is described only
as <i>placid</i>, not as <i>clear</i>; and as appears from <i>Æn.</i> vii. 31., was
actually <i>very muddy</i>,<a id="muddy89"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[89]</span> "multa flavus arena." The immediately
preceding words, "variisque teguntur arboribus," have been pronounced by
a very learned critic (one who has often deserved well of Virgil) to be
<i>idle, otiosa</i>. (See Wagner ad <i>Æn.</i> i.&nbsp;678.) And his opinion has been
sanctioned by the usually judicious Forbiger. But they are not idle; on
the contrary, they are necessary to convey the idea that the Æneadæ
passed up the river <i>under the shade of the trees</i>; and so are
supplemental to the statement contained in the words cited by your
correspondent, which inform us only that they went up the river. Hence a
confirmation of the correctness of the received interpretation.</p>

<p>Your correspondent E<span class="smcap lowercase">RYX</span> wishes to know, whether in the passage (<i>Æneid</i>,
viii. 96.)&mdash;</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p> "Viridesque secant placido æquore silvas,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the word <i>secant</i> can legitimately convey the same idea that is
expressed in Tennyson's lines&mdash;</p>

      <div class="poem">
  <p class="i5">  &mdash;&mdash; "my shallop ... clove</p>
     <p> The citron shadows in the blue."</p>
</div>

<p>There can be little doubt that this well-known passage in the <i>Æneid</i> is
the <i>original</i> of Tennyson's image; that, in fact, it is an excusable
plagiarism on the part of the latter, who, in introducing, his image,
has, I think, missed the appropriateness, and therefore increased
beauty, belonging to it in the original passage of Virgil.</p>

<p>When Æneas is journeying up the Tiber to visit Evander, the river, in
order to lessen his labours&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
 <p> "refluens ... substitit unda;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but notwithstanding this, the journey was arduous as is shown in the
<i>whole</i> of the three lines 94-96.</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p> "Olli remigio noctemque diemque fatigant,</p>
      <p>Et longos superant flexes, variisque teguntur</p>
      <p>Arboribus, viridesque secant pacido æquore silvas."</p>
</div>

<p>That is to say, "They labour at the oar till night is wearied out, and
day also is obliged to give place in its turn; they master one by one
the long serpentine bends of the river, and, though covered and inclosed
by the varied foliage above them, they cut their way through the
opposing woods, which lie, as it were, in their path in the shadowy
surface of the clear, still water."</p>

<p>The word <i>placido</i> is surely sufficient to prevent any one falling into
the common-place interpretation alluded to by your correspondent as the
one "usually given."</p>

<h3><span>THE VINE OF ST. FRANCIS.<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 502.)</span></h3>

<p>I feel much obliged for the information afforded by your Dutch
correspondent. When I sent you my Query on the subject more than a year
ago, I wrote principally from memory; but as I have now the work in
question lying beside me as I write, and as it seems to be rarer and
less known than I had imagined, you will perhaps find place for a more
minute description of it.</p>

<p><i>The Vine of St. Francis</i> is a folio volume, containing 418 numbered
leaves, a "Prologhe" of one leaf (next to the title-page), and a "Tafel
v&#257; dit boeck" at the end, of five leaves and a half unnumbered.</p>

<p>The title-page contains a full-length picture of the saint, with a
nimbus round his head, the knotted cord round his waist, and his palms
extended, displaying the sacred stigmata. Above the picture is the title
in red and black. I have written in Italics the words printed in red:</p>

<p>The preface to the <i>Grote Legende</i> informs us that it is Saint
Bonaventura's life of Saint Francis, and mentions why it is called the
<i>Great Legend</i>. This life ends at folio 47.</p>

<p>The preface to the <i>Oude Legende</i>, which next follows, states that it is
"gathered from the<a id="from90"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[90]</span> writings of his companions and the chronicles
of the order of the Brothers Minor;" and the "Prologhe" (which succeeds
the preface) mentions&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Die leg&#275;de van zÿn drie gesellen den spiegel der

<p class="noindent">These lives, I suppose, are&mdash;that joint narrative compiled by three
intimate associates of the Saint, "zÿn drie gesellen," that composed by
Thomas of Celano; and the <i>Liber Conformitatum</i>.</p>

<p>The 39th chap. of this <i>Oude Legende</i>, folio ciii., relates, as the
preface says&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "¶ Hoe dat S. F. woude reysen in verre l&#257;den om dat vole te

<p class="noindent">On which Jewish-converting martyrdom-seeking journey Dr. Geddes (in his
curious little work on the <i>Romish Orders of Monks and Friars</i>, Lond.
1714) quaintly remarks:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "A Quaker's having gone from England to Rome to convert the pope
   to his religion, is a mighty jest with some people, who are very
   much edified with this story of Francis's going from Italy to
   Egypt to convert the sultan, but these two adventures do to me
   appear to be so much alike that I shall leave it to anatomists to
   tell whether good wits that prompt others, have not their brains
   either made of the same size, or much in the same posture."</p>

<p>The <i>Oude Legende</i> ends folio 44. Next follows:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "¶ Die historie van d&#275; aflaet van Sinte Maria van d&#275;
   enghelen diem&#275; porti&#363;kel heet,"</p>

<p class="noindent">as the preface hath it. Some of your readers may have seen an
advertisement respecting a series of Franciscan works (to be published,
I think, by Richardson of Derby), entitled the <i>Portioncule Library</i>;
and seeing in the above table of contents "Die aflaet van Portiunkel,"
or the Indulgence of the <i>Portiunkel</i>, they may be at a loss to know its
meaning, so I shall quote a note from Mrs. Jameson's highly interesting
and valuable work on the <i>Monastic Orders</i>, which is to the purpose:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"The term Porzioncula means literally 'a small portion, share,
   or allotment.' The name was given to a slip of land, of a few
   acres in extent, at the foot of the hill of Assisi, and on which
   stood a little chapel; both belonged to a community of
   Benedictines, who afterwards bestowed the land and the chapel on
   the brotherhood of S. Francis. This chapel was then familiarly
   known as the 'Capella della Porzioncula.' Whether the title by
   which it has since become famous as the S. Maria-degli-Angeli
   belonged to it originally, or because the angels were heard
   singing around and above it at the time of the birth of St.
   Francis, does not seem clear. At all events this chapel became
   early sanctified as the scene of the ecstasies and visions of the
   saint; here also S. Clara made her profession. Particular
   indulgences were granted to those who visited it for confession
   and repentance on the fifth of August and it became a celebrated
   place of pilgrimage in the fourteenth century. Mr. Ford tells us,
   that in Spain the term <i>Porzioncula</i> is applied generally to
   distinguish the chapel or sanctuary dedicated to St. Francis
   within the Franciscan churches. The original chapel of the
   Porzioncula now stands in the centre of the magnificent church
   which has been erected over it."</p>

<p>In the "Legende" of St. Anthony of Padua, chap. vii. fol. ccxx., we have
that saint's "sermo ad pisces" in the city of Rimini, <i>die vol ketters
was</i>, and the conversion therefrom of the said <i>ketters</i> or heretics.</p>

<p>The "Prologhe" to the narrative "van die vÿf Martelaren," fol.
clxxviii., commences, "Ego quasi Vitis fructificavi suavitatem odoris
alo cen&#275; wÿngaert," &amp;c.: here we learn why the work is called <i>Den
Wÿngaert</i>, or <i>The Vine</i>.</p>

<p>In the "tractat v&#257; S. F. orden en&#772; reghele," at fol. cccxxix., we
have an account of Brother Agnellus of Pisa his mission to England in
1224.</p>

<p>In the "Getal der broeder&#275; en&#772; prouintien," at fol. cccci., we
learn that at that time (1518) England had 7 convents and 200 friars;
Ireland 15 convents and 400 friars; and Scotland 8 convents and 120
friars.</p>

<p>The "Kalendier" which follows this "Getal" is printed in red and black.</p>

<p>"Den aflaet v&#257; rom&#275;" is the last tract in the book. Here is the
finis:</p>

is given the "Canticum solis," part of which Sir James Stephen quotes in

<p>An extraordinary mode of swearing, akin to the oaths already noticed,
is recorded by Ysbrant Ides in his <i>Travels from Moscow to China</i>
(London, 1705, and reprinted in the second volume of Harris's
Collection):&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Two<a id="Two91"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[91]</span> Tunguzian hostages falling out, one accused the other before
   the Waywode (or Viceroy) of having conjured his deceased brother
   to death. The Waywode asked the accuser if he would, according to
   the Tunguzian custom, put the accused to his oath? To this he
   answered in the affirmative; after which the accused took a <i>live
   dog</i>, laid him on the ground, and with a knife stuck him into the
   body, just under his left foot, and immediately clapped his mouth
   to the wound, and sucked out the dog's blood as long as he could
   come at it; after which he lift him up, laid him on his
   shoulders, and clapped his mouth again to the wound in order to
   suck out the remaining blood. An excellent drink indeed! And this
   is the greatest oath and most solemn confirmation of the Truth
   amongst them; so that on credit of this the accused was set free,
   and the accuser punished for his false accusation."</p>

<p>The dog, designed, as Cicero observes, for man's use, was doubtless
selected for his sagacity and faithfulness; and by Loccenius, in his
<i>Leges W. Gothicæ</i>, "tria canum capita" are stated to have been
"Hunnorum gentis insignia," the progenitors of the Tunguzians, p. 107.
In Northern Europe "sanguine Deos placari creditum; canibus etiam cum
hominibus permistè in luco suspensis." (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 105.)</p>

<p>Among the northern nations, not only their testimoniary oaths were thus
sanctioned by blood, but their confederative also, in which their
fraternisation was symbolised by reciprocal transfusion of blood.</p>

      <div class="poem">
<p>"Dear as the blood that warms my heart."</p>
     <p> Gray's <i>Bard</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>It was the custom of the Scythians "non dextras tantum implicare, sed
pollices mutuo vincire, nodoque perstringere; mox sanguine in artus
extremos se effundente levi ritu <i>cruorem elicere</i>, atque invicem
lambere." (Hanseanius <i>De Jurejurando Verterum</i>.) Quintus Curtius
remarks that among the Hindoos (between whom and the Scythians Sir W.
Jones and other ethnographers have observed various traces of affinity)
the joining of right hands was their usual mode of salutation; "dextra
fidei sedes."</p>

<p>En passant, I have elsewhere seen the opinion quoted by a correspondent
(Vol. ii., p. 464), "Sedem animæ in digitis ponunt," attributed to the
Hindoos. Query, Has not the profession of <ins title="[Greek: thelêtai]">&#952;&#949;&#955;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;</ins> (see Dr.
Maitland on <i>Mesmerism</i>) prevailed among them? Their propensity to
conjuring is so proverbial, that, according to a writer in the <i>Asiatic
Researches</i>, that term is derived from one of their tribes. See also on
their witchcrafts, Acosta's <i>East and West Indies</i>, chap. xxvi.</p>

<p>Before I dismiss the subject of swearing, permit me to observe what
appears to me to be the origin of the apothegm "Fiat Justitia, ruat
C&oelig;lum" (Vol. ii., p. 494.), which, with a slight change, was
afterwards adopted by Ferdinand, emperor of Austria.</p>

<p>May it not have originated in an oath similar to that of Chaganus, king
of the Huns, recorded by Otrokoesi, in his <i>Historiæ Hungaricæ</i>?&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Abarico ritu jusjurandum ad hunc modum præstitit. Ense edueto et
   in altum sublato sibi et Abaricorum genti dira imprecatus <i>si

<h3><span>HUGH HOLLAND AND HIS WORKS.<br />
(Vol. iii. p. 427.; Vol. iv., p. 62.)</span></h3>


<p>The querist on Hugh Holland and his works, must be content with a reply
of unvarnished brevity.</p>

<p>1. "Where are these lines taken from, and what do they mean?"&mdash;The lines
are from the <i>Cypress garland</i> of Hugh Holland, 1625. 4to. The meaning
is obvious. I assume that Holland may be trusted as to his own age, to
which Wood gives no clue.</p>

<p>2. "Who says he did not quit Westminster school till 1589?"&mdash;Wood says
he was bred in Westminster school, and "elected into Trinity coll. in
Cambridge, an. 1589." Welch, from official documents, gives the same
date. Wood nowhere states that he "matriculated at Baliol in 1582."</p>

<p>3. "My words are, '<i>about</i> 1590 he succeeded to a fellowship.'"&mdash;Wood
says he was elected to Trinity college in 1589, "of which he was
<i>afterwards</i> fellow." It may have been some years afterwards.</p>

<p>4. "Why does not M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> give your readers his interpretation of the
mysterious H. H.?"&mdash;He reserved it for another occasion, but now
consents to satisfy the curiosity of the querist and others.</p>

<p>In 1632 Henry Holland dedicated to Charles I. an English version of the
<i>Cyrvpædia</i> of Xenophon, made by his father Philemon Holland. In the
dedication, which is signed at length, he says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Also, when any unworthy selfe (anno 1620) offred mine owne
   collections, entituled <i>Herwologia Anglica</i>, unto his highnesse
   [James I.], he most graciously received it."</p>

<p>In 1614 appeared, under the initials "H. H.," the <i>Monvmenta
sepvlchraria sancti Pavli</i>, and in the address <i>ad lectorem</i> we
read:<a id="read92"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Et non solùm nomine bonus appellatus est [sc. Alex. Nowel], sed
   etiam et in vita sua bonitas apparuit, et in morte bona sua opera
   illum sunt sequuta, et uberiùs et fusiùs in <i>Effigiebus</i> nostris
   et <i>vitis illustrium Anglorum</i> cum de Coleto tum de illo apparet:
   (quæ nunc transmarino habitu vestiendæ sunt) quare hic illum
   pluribus prosequi verbis non est opus."</p>

<p>Here is unanswerable evidence that Henry Holland was the compiler of
both works. In the catalogue of the Grenville collection of books, now
in the British Museum, both works are ascribed to Hugh Holland.</p>

<p>5. "The edition of 1614 was certainly the first, and that of 1633
<i>certainly</i> the second."&mdash;The querist adopts my correction of his
threefold error, and calls it an <i>answer</i>!</p>

<p>6. "I shall therefore leave the shade of Cole and
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> to
settle the question as to whether any such work exists."&mdash;The querist
did not perceive that the <i>Roxana of Alexander</i> was an error for the
<i>Roxana of Alabaster</i>&mdash;so he endeavours to draw off the attention of his
readers from this proof of critical obtuseness by a common-place
witticism.</p>

<p>I must describe the facile process by which our querist has obtained his
apparent triumph. Wood, at the close of his article on Hugh Holland the
poet, which is chiefly derived from the <i>Worthies</i> of Fuller, mentions
one Hugh Holland as admitted B.A. in 1570, and another Hugh Holland as
matriculated at Baliol college in 1582, aged twenty-four; with others of
that surname. He adds, "but whether any of them were authors, I cannot
yet tell, or <i>whether the last was the same with the poet</i>. Qu." Now,
with regard to the first and second articles, our querist omits the
sentence which proves the inapplicability of his quotations! and with
regard to the third article, he omits the word <i>afterwards</i>, which forms
the gist of the argument.</p>

<h3><span>LADY FLORA HASTINGS' BEQUEST.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 44.)</span></h3>

<p>"Assertion is not proof," and it surely does require <i>proof</i> ere we
consent to brand a writer of unimpeached character with the charge of "a
shameless, heartless act of literary piracy."</p>

<p>It rests with E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span> to bring forward his or her <i>proof</i> that the lines in
dispute were written by Lady Flora. E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span> asserted that they were "never
before printed." I have enabled him or her to satisfy himself or herself
that they were in print <i>nearly</i> twelve years ago. I am disposed to
believe E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span> equally mistaken in the assertion as to the authorship of
the lines. If this prove so, the imputation cast upon Miss Barber will
revert upon her accuser, and will demand the most ample apology.</p>

<p>I do not know Miss Barber; her writings I have long admired; and having
been the means of drawing down upon her such an accusation, I am not
disposed to let the inquiry terminate here. Nor can I believe the Editor
of  "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"
 will desire that either a literary error or a
groundless slander should descend to posterity in his pages.</p>

 <p class="right">   L. H. K.</p>


<p>E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span> cannot entertain a higher respect than I do for the memory of Lady
Flora Hastings; but I am sure no member of her family would countenance
any attempt to exalt her reputation at the expense of another's; and I
fear E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span>, however unintentionally, has fallen into this error. The
stanzas she attributed to Lady Flora, as L. H. K. stated (Vol. iii., p.
522.), were published as Miss M. A. S. Barber's in <i>The Christian Lady's
Magazine</i> for September, 1839, only two months after Lady Flora's death.
In the preceding number, as L. H. K. also correctly stated, is a brief
memoir of Lady Flora, in which it is said, that shortly before her death
she "delivered to her fond brother a little Bible, the gift of her
mother, requesting him to restore it to that beloved parent," &amp;c.
E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span>
may be unacquainted with that publication, but I can assure her that
Lady Flora's brother, my esteemed and lamented patron, was not; for
shortly after the number appeared, I found it lying on his table, in his
own private room at Donington Park, and, while waiting to see him,
partly read it there myself for the first time. I know not whether he
ever read the lines in question in the succeeding number, but I know the
<i>Magazine</i> was regularly taken by some of Lady Flora's intimate friends,
and I cannot suppose they would allow any poem of hers to pass unnoticed
for twelve years, with the signature of Miss Barber attached to it.
Indeed the stanzas bear internal evidence of being written after Lady
Flora's death, and founded on the account given by <i>Charlotte Elizabeth</i>
in the preceding number. If, however, E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span> still persists in attributing
them to Lady Flora Hastings, she is in duty bound to give her authority,
and not bring such a heavy accusation against Miss Barber on the bare
assertion of an anonymous correspondent. If Miss Barber really composed
the stanzas, as I believe she did, she was doubtless actuated with a
desire to honour the memory and character of Lady Flora; and in such
case nothing could be more cruel and unjust than the conduct imputed to
her by E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span>. Unfortunately I do not know Miss Barber's address, or
whether she is still living; but if any of your readers do, I hope they
will name this case to her, or her friends, that her reputation may be
cleared from the imputation thus rashly cast on it. If the case cannot
thus be satisfactorily settled, I will obtain the desired information
from another quarter; but I hope E<span class="smcap lowercase">RZA</span> will also offer the assistance in
her power towards this desirable object; and to<a id="object93"></a>

<h4><span><i>Coke and Cowper</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 24.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In reply to one of your
correspondents, who inquires as to the correct pronunciation of the name
of the poet <i>Cowper</i>, I may mention, that some years ago, being on a
visit in the neighbourhood of Weston Underwood, I made particular
inquiries on this point in the village, and found that <i>there</i> the poet
had always been known as Mr. C<i>oo</i>per. The name of the noble family to
which he was related will be the best criterion.</p>

<p>By the way, was there not sometime since a proposal for erecting by
subscription a worthy monument to a poet whose memory every Christian
must revere? In whose hands was this project, and with whom does its
execution rest?</p>

<p class="left"> Highfield, near Southampton, July 22. 1851.</p>


<p>In my humble opinion, Coke is the old English form of writing <i>cook</i>,
from A.-Sax. "cóc." See Chaucer's <i>Coke's Tale</i>, and <i>Cock Lorrell's
Bote</i>, where we read "Drouers, Cokes, and pulters;" and in this same
poem occurs the line, "Carpenters, <i>coupers</i>, and ioyners." See also
under Cooper in Pegge's <i>Anecdotes of the English Language</i>; the names,
as thus pronounced, are rendered significant.</p>

<p>Should it be asked how we ought to pronounce the name of another poet,
viz. Cowley, if Cowper be called Cooper, I answer that they are from
different roots: that Cowley is from <i>cow</i>, and <i>ley</i>, signifying cow
pasture, or place for cows; and that Cowper is only another form of
Cooper: not but that in the north they pronounce <i>cow</i> as <i>coo</i>, and,
therefore, they would call him Cooley.</p>

not, as M. S. supposes, always accompanied by the Christian name for
unmarried ladies; and the custom lasted at least as late as the reign of
George II. Pope in his letters (about 1719) mentions "Mrs. Lepel" and
"Mrs. Bellenden," maids of honour. The examples are innumerable, but the
<i>latest</i> instance I remember is the Duchess of Queensbury addressing
Patty Blount in 1756 as "Mrs. Blount;" though, no doubt, Patty was, by
<i>that time</i>, entitled to what is called <i>brevet</i> rank.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
